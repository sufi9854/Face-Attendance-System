## 📌 Overview

This project automates the process of taking attendance using real-time face recognition. It uses a webcam to detect and recognize faces, records attendance in a CSV file with date and timestamp, and is built using OpenCV and Python.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📸 Real-time face detection and recognition
- 🧠 LBPH Face Recognizer using OpenCV
- 📂 Dataset collection via webcam
- 🗃️ Attendance stored in `.csv` format
- 🧾 Simple GUI using Tkinter (optional)
- 💾 No internet required, works offline
- 🔒 Contactless & hygienic solution

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sufi9854/Face-Attendance-System.git
cd Face-Attendance-System
````

### 2. Install Requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> If you don’t have a `requirements.txt`, you can install directly:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

### 1. Capture Face Images

```bash
python data_capture.py
```

➡️ This captures multiple images of a user and stores them in the `dataset/` folder.

### 2. Train the Recognizer

```bash
python train_model.py
```

➡️ Trains the model and creates `trainer.yml` inside `trainer/` folder.

### 3. Start Attendance Recognition

```bash
python main.py
```

➡️ Detects and recognizes faces in real time. Logs name + timestamp to `attendance.csv`.

---

## 🖼️ Screenshots (Optional)

> Add screenshots here later (e.g., dataset capture, recognition in action, CSV log, GUI)

```
📸 dataset/            --> saved face images  
✅ attendance.csv      --> automatically logs attendance  
👨‍💻 GUI (Tkinter)     --> optional visual interface  
```
